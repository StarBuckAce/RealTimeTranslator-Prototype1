# RealTimeTranslator-Prototype1
The Real-Time Translator is a Python-based project that allows users to input spoken or typed text, translate it into a target language, and generate an audio output of the translation.
It combines three functionalities:

Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text using speech_recognition.
Text Translation: Translates the recognized or typed text into a target language using googletrans.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the translated text into speech using gTTS and plays the audio output.
The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with Flask, where users can interact by typing text, selecting the target language, and listening to the translated output.

It can be hosted as a web application for real-time, multilingual communication.
